# 🛡️ Skyshield — Cloud Breach Simulation & Defense Automation System (CBSDAS)

Skyshield is a cloud security project designed to simulate common cloud attacks and detect misconfigurations across AWS services.  
It includes attack modules, detection modules, and a simple Flask-based dashboard to visualize security risks in real time.

This project is intended for learning, research, and demonstrating cloud security concepts.
